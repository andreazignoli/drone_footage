# Insights in road cycling downhill performance using aerial drone footages and an 'optimal' reference trajectory

üëã Hi, welcome to the project repository. 

## Synopsis

A new methodology to study performance in downhill road cycling is presented here. A drone was used to capture the trajectory of the centre of mass of a cyclist, who was asked to complete 10 times a ~220-meter-long downhill course. Motion capture trajectories were compared to a theoretical *optimal* trajectory in terms of displacement, speed, and heading. In each trial, the *apex*, the *turn-in* and the *braking points* were detected. Whilst the *optimal* trajectory suggested an *early* apex strategy was best, the cyclist in this study completed the corners with a *late* apex strategy. Therefore, this study presents a methodology that can be used to objectively assess cornering strategies in road cycling.

## Data availability

The code used for the motion capture position detection is of course provided with this repository. Additionally, you can find the files of the üöÅ videos at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z8yeZPSoOn0l1lVK-wkxGGMYXhY3we03?usp=sharing).

## Mathematical model of bike-rider dynamics

The bike-rider model includes a number of differential equations. The reader is invited to read the 'Additional reading' papers (links below) for definition of the symbols and of the parameters.

The equation of motion for the heading angle is:

![alpha](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{d}{ds}\alpha(s)=\frac{\delta_n(s)\delta_{max}}{L\dot{s}(s)}-\kappa(s)) 

The equation of motion for the lateral displacement is:

![n](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{d}{ds}n(s)=\frac{1}{\dot{s}(s)}\left(v(s)\sin(\alpha(s))\right)) 

The equation of motion for the roll angle is:

![phi](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{d}{ds}\phi(s)=\frac{\dot{\phi}(s)}{\dot{s}(s)})

The equation of motion for the normalized steering angle is:

![delta_n](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{d}{ds}\delta_n(s)=\frac{\dot{\delta}_n(s)}{\dot{s}(s)})

The equation of motion for the time is:

![time](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{d}{ds}t(s)=-\frac{1+\kappa(s)n(s)}{\cos(\alpha(s))v(s)})

The equation of motion for the time-derivative of the curvilinear abscissa is:

![s_dot](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{d}{ds}\dot{s}(s)=\frac{v(s)\cos(\alpha(s))}{1-n(s)\kappa(s)})

The equation of motion for the time-derivative of the roll angle is:

![phi_dot](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{d}{ds}\dot{\phi}(s)=\frac{hmg}{I_XgL\dot{s}(s)}(v(s)^2\delta_{max}\delta_n(s)+Lg\phi(s)))

The equation of motion for the normalized power output is:

![W_n](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{d}{ds}W_n(s)=\frac{\dot{W}_n(s)}{\dot{s}(s)})

The equation of motion for the longitudinal speed is:

![v](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\tiny\frac{mv(s)}{W_{max}}\frac{d}{ds}v(s)=\frac{W_n(s)}{\dot{s}(s)}-\frac{v(s)}{\dot{s}(s)W_{max}}(mg[C_{rr}\cos(\beta(s))+\sin(\beta(s))]+k_v(v(s)-V_w(\alpha(s)))^2))
